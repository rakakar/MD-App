 * - **CountedSegmented** splits one set into named parts that add up — All 73 /
 *   Audios 35 / Videos 38. The counts are the point; the reader is choosing
 *   how much to look at.
 * - **CountTabs** switches between two different things about the same object —
 *   a book's chapters and a book's highlights. Nothing adds up.
 * - **Chip** turns a filter on or off. Many can be on at once.
 *
 * Collapsing them into one "segmented control" is how a filter starts looking
 * like a tab, which is how a reader stops being able to guess what tapping it
 * will do.
